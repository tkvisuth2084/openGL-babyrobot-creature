# OpenGL Baby Robot Creature

A small 3D creature built in Python using OpenGL. It’s assembled from simple shapes
(cubes, spheres, cylinders) and uses hierarchical modeling so each joint can rotate and
move the rest of the body. This project was a way for me to explore transformation matrices,
rendering, and basic character rigging in a custom graphics pipeline.

Here are some images of the Creature!
